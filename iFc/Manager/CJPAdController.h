 Call this method to remove ads from the view
 
 If `permanent` is set to YES, ads will not show until the app is next launched, or until the restartAds method is called.
 
 When set to NO, ads will only be removed off-screen temporarily - typically just a few minutes until the delegate receives a new ad.
 You probably won't have a use for this in production, but may find it useful when testing.
 
 If `permanent` AND `remember` are both set to YES, a boolean will be set in NSUserDefaults to remember this across future app launches.
 A typical use of this might be if your user purchases an IAP to remove ads from the app.

 Call this method to restart ad serving.
 
 This is intended to be called after removeAdsAndMakePermanent:YES has been called.
 It WILL take into account the andRemember boolean though, so ad serving will not be restarted

/* SETTINGS */

// Set which ad networks should be used, in order of preference (default: CJPAdNetworkiAd, CJPAdNetworkAdMob)
@property (nonatomic, strong, setter=setAdNetworks:) NSArray *adNetworks;

// Set where ads should be position in the view (default: CJPAdPositionBottom)
@property (nonatomic, assign) CJPAdPosition adPosition;

// Set how many seconds we should wait before attempting to show an ad after the app is launched (default: 0.0)
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSTimeInterval initialDelay;

// Set to YES if you want ads to appear ABOVE the tab bar rather than below it
// only takes affect if position is set to CJPAdPositionBottom and you are using a UITabBarController
// WARNING: This behaviour is very buggy in iOS >= 7. It is recommended you do not use this any more.
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL aboveTabBar;


/* ADMOB SPECIFIC SETTINGS */

// AdMob Unit ID for the banner you want to display. This will be a long string containing your Google publisher ID following by an identifier for the banner
// It should look similar to the following: ca-app-pub-1234567890987654/1234567890
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *adMobUnitID;

// Use AdMob's "Smart Size" banners? By default this is set to YES
// If set to NO, 320x50 ads will be used for iPhone/iPod and 728x90 for iPad
// For more info see: https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/smart-banners
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL useAdMobSmartSize;

// An array of UDID strings of devices that you want to show AdMob test ads on.
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *testDeviceIDs;

// COPPA Compliance - by default this is left unset, but you can set the value to either 0 or 1 if you wish, based on the following guidelines:
/*
 From: https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/additional-controls#coppa-setting
 If you set tagForChildDirectedTreatment to 1, you will indicate that your content should be treated as child-directed for purposes of COPPA.
 If you set tagForChildDirectedTreatment to 0, you will indicate that your content should not be treated as child-directed for purposes of COPPA.
 If you do not set tagForChildDirectedTreatment, ad requests will include no indication of how you would like your content treated with respect to COPPA.
 By setting this tag, you certify that this notification is accurate and you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the app. You understand that abuse of this setting may result in termination of your Google account.
 */
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *tagForChildDirectedTreatment;


/* OTHER SETTINGS */

// This will be set automatically based on a NSUserDefaults boolean.
// It will always be NO unless you have called [[CJPAdController sharedInstance] removeAdsAndMakePermanent:YES andRemember:YES];
// This property is here simply for convenience, allowing you to manually set it to YES from your app delegate if you wish to use your app without ads while testing for example.
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL adsRemoved;
